Only admins or assigned editors are able to change content settings.

Content types determine the attributes and rules of your content.

To change the content type of a content item:

1.  Open the content item you wish to change.
2.  Change the content type using one of two ways:
    * Click the \'Add content type\' link at the top of the page if your
      content doesn\'t currently have a content type.
    * Click the \'Actions\' button and select Edit.

3.  Select the content type you want from the drop down. Alternatively
    you can leave the content type field blank. Click Save.

Warning: Changing or removing your content\'s content type will delete
any values that were set as the previous content type\'s attributes.
