Once content is published or no longer moving through the workflow, e.g.
stalled content, we recommend that you archive it.

Archiving removes content from your content list. Archived content is
still accessible via Content and the Archives tab.

Only admins and editors are able
to archive content.

To archive content:

1.  Open the content item you wish to archive.
2.  Click the Actions button at the top of the content box.
3.  Select Archive from the dropdown.

This will flag the content as archived.

To view archived content go to Content and click on the Archives tab. This list can be searched and
filtered.

To retrieve an archived content item and place it back into the workflow, click the Actions button at the top
of the content box and select activate.
