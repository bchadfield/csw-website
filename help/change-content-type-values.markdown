Applying an updated/edited content type will delete any values in your
content that were set as part of the previous content type\'s
attributes.

Only admins can change the content type of a content
item.

Updating a content item\'s content type is a two-step process.

1.  Open the content item you want to apply the changed content type to.
2.  Click on the Actions button and select Edit from the drop down.
3.  Select the blank option in the content type drop down. This will
    remove the content\'s current content type.
4.  Click Save.

To instate the edited content type, click on the Actions button and
select Edit as before. This time select the updated/edited content type.

The updated/edited content type\'s properties will now be applied to
your content.

This means that the previous content type attributes will be replaced
with the updated attributes and any values that were previously set will
have been removed.

You can apply an updated/edited content type to [multiple content items](/help/content/change-multiple-content.html).
