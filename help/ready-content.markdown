Content in the Ready stage has been approved and is ready to go live. No
edits can be made to content in this stage. If changes are needed,
content will need to be moved back to Draft or Edit stages.

Content enters the Ready stage in two ways:

1.  *Manually*\: an admin can move content to the
    Ready stage at any time. This content will be flagged as not being
    approved.
2.  *Automatically from Approval stage*\: when the content has been
    approved it enters the Ready stage.

To help publish your content there are a few export options available to
content in the Ready stage:

* [Export](/help/content/export-content.html) to Markdown, HTML, or plain text.
* Publish to an [integrated platform](/help/integrations/).

Click the \'Show HTML\' button to switch between the formatted content and HTML source.

Tip: Copying and pasting the content\'s HTML to your publishing platform
will give you more accurate styles than copying and pasting the
formatted content.
