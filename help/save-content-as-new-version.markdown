[Content versioning](/help/versions/content-versioning.html) already happens automatically throughout the
workflow, however, there may be situations where you want to create a
backup version of changes, e.g. changes made to a content item in Draft,
prior to it being moved to the edit stage.

Only admins and editors are able to save content as a new version.

To save content as a new version:

1.  Open the content item in question.
2.  Click the \'Actions\' button and select \'Save as new version\' from the dropdown.

A new version of the content will be created that can be viewed,
compared with or reverted to in the Versions tab on the right side of
the screen.
