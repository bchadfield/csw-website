Content versions help you to keep track of what changes were made to
your content and when they were made. Versions can be [viewed](/help/versions/view-content-versions.html),
[compared with](/help/versions/compare-content-versions.html)
and [reverted to](/help/versions/revert-to-a-content-version.html) in the
Versions tab of the content item.

Versions track changes to the content body, content type attributes and
the workflow stage of the content.

Content versioning happens automatically in the workflow. A new version is created when content enters a stage where it can
be edited, that is, in Draft and Edit.

New versions of content are only created automatically when there are
differences between the current and previous version (if one exists).

Admins can also [manually create new versions of content](/help/content/save-content-as-new-version.html).
