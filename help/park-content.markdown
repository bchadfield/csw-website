Only admins and editors can park content.

Parking content places it on hold. This can be used as a backlog of
ideas or to set aside content that has stalled.

To park a content item:

1.  Open the content you want to park.
2.  Click the \'Actions\' button on the top of the content box.
3.  Click \'Park\'.

The content will now be out of the workflow and read-only.

To unpark content, simply move it into any workflow stage. We recommend
starting with [Draft](/help/workflow/draft-content.html) so that the content is at
the start of the workflow.
