Only admins or assigned editors are able to change multiple content
items.

The category, content type and preview template can be changed on
multiple content items simultaneously.

You can make changes to multiple content items using one of two ways:

* Go to Content, click the Content tab.
* Go to Content, click on the Categories tab and select the category you
  want to make changes to.

For either of these options:

1.  Check the checkboxes of the content items you want to change.
2.  Click the \'Selected\' button and select \'Edit\' from the drop
    down. This action will open the Edit content form.
3.  Tick the checkbox for the field(s) you want to change.
    * *Category*\: Enter the name of the category. The category name
      will autocomplete so if you type in the first few letters of an
      existing category, you will be able to select that category from a
      drop down. New categories can also be created by entering them in
      this field.
    * *Content type*\: Select the content type from the drop down.
    * *Preview template*\: Select the preview content from the drop
      down.
4.  Click Save.

Caution: Changing or removing your content\'s content type will delete any
values that were set as the previous content type\'s attributes.
