Only admins are able to change content settings.

Content categories can be used to group your content in the workspace.

To change a content item\'s category:

1.  Open the content item you wish to change.
2.  If no category currently exists, click the Add category link at
    the top of the page. If there is an existing category, click the
    Actions button and select Edit from the drop down.
3.  Change the category by typing the category name into the
    autocomplete field.
    * *Create new category:* Type the name of the new category you want
      to create. If the category doesn\'t exist it will be created when
      you click Save.
    * *Add existing category:* Start typing the name of the category you
      want to add the content to. Select the existing category from the
      available options.
    * *Remove content from category:* Delete the category name from the
      category field and leave it blank.
4.  Click Save.
