Only admins and editors are able to publish to integrated Twitter
accounts.

Only content in the Ready and Live stages can be published to Twitter.

To publish to Twitter:

1.  Open the content item you want to tweet.
2.  Click on the \'Export\' button.
3.  Select the Twitter integration from the drop down. This will show
    you a preview of the tweet.
4.  Click \'Tweet\' to publish the content to Twitter.
    * Twitter will automatically shorten any URLs.
    * The length of shortened URLs is 25 characters at this time.
    * If the tweet is too long the tweet won\'t publish and you will be
      shown an error.

Move the content to the Live stage in CS Workflow to notify everyone
associated with content that is has gone live.
