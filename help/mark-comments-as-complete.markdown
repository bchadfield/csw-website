As well as providing feedback, comments can also act as a todo list for
people responding to feedback.

Only admins are able to mark comments as complete.

Marking a comment as complete lets everyone know that the feedback as
been actioned.

To mark a comment as complete, simply click the empty checkbox icon in
the top right of the comment. This will check off the comment and grey
it out.

To uncheck a comment simply click the checked checkbox icon.
