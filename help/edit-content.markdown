Content can only be edited by the workspace admins.

If you want to edit content that is in the review or approval stages, click on
the coloured drop down menu at the top of the content box and click
\'Edit\'.

Manually moving the content to the edit creates a new version of the content so that changes can be tracked against previous versions.

Content automatically re-enters the edit stage when the review stage 
has been completed. The content owner will be able to see reviewers' comments and mark
them as complete or reply where relevant.

Once editing is finished, the content owner or another admin can send the content for Approval or back to the Review
stage if changes require further review.
