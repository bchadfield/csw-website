Only admins are able to archive multiple content items.

You can archive multiple content items using one of two ways:

* Go to Content and click on Content tab.
* Go to Content, click on the Categories tab and select a category from the list.

For either of these options:

1.  Check the checkboxes of the content items you want to archive.
2.  Click the Selected button.
3.  Select Archive from the drop down.

To view archived content, go to Content and click on the Archive tab.
