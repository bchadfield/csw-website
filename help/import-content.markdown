The import function allows you to
bring in content from DOCX and Markdown files on your computer. This

Only admins and editors are able
to import content.

To import content:



1.  Open the content item you
    want to import content to.
2.  Click the \'Actions\'
    button.
3.  Select \'Import\' from the
    drop down. This will display the Import form.
4.  Click Browse and navigate to
    and select the .docx, .markdown, or .md file you want to
    import.
5.  Click Import to add selected
    file\'s content to your CS Workflow content item.



**DOCX**

The .docx file contents will be
converted to clean HTML. The conversion process supports headings, bold,
underline and italic text formats.

For headings to be imported
correctly, headings needs to added through the styles bar in your docx.
editor.

Where formats are not supported,
the content will appear as plain text.



**Markdown**

We use [Kramdown][1] to convert Markdown to HTML.
