The import function allows you to
bring in content from DOCX and Markdown files on your computer. This
function is only available at the Draft and Edit stages.

Only admins are able to import content.

To import content:

1.  Open the content item you want to import content to.
2.  Click the \'Actions\' button.
3.  Select \'Import\' from the drop down. This will display the Import form.
4.  Click Browse and navigate to and select the .docx, .markdown, or .md file you want to import.
5.  Click Import to add selected file\'s content to your CS Workflow content item.

### DOCX

The .docx file contents will be converted to clean HTML. The conversion process
supports headings, bold underline and italic text formats.

For headings to be imported correctly, headings needs to added through the
styles bar in your docx editor.

Where formats are not supported,
the content will appear as plain text.


### Markdown

We use [Kramdown][1] to convert Markdown to HTML.
