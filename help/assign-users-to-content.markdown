Only admins are able to assign content to people to review and approve.

User avatars, found above the top-right of the content, show who is
currently assigned to the content.

Hovering your mouse over an assigned user\'s avatar shows you a summary of
their assignment.

Content is assigned to people when it is sent to them for review or approval. 
Content can even be assigned to people who aren't part of the workspace team yet.
Assigning content to new people is done by adding their email address in the review
or approval box. They are then invited to the team and can start reviewing or approving
content right away.
