There are two parts to approving content: sending content for approval and approving the content.
Only an admin can send content for approval.

To send content for approval:

1.  Navigate to the content you want approved.
2.  Click the workflow button that sits in the top-middle of the screen. This will dropdown to
		display all the workflow stages.
3. 	Click \'Approval\' and the approval form will pop up.
4.	The approval form's entry field acts like the To field in email. Click it to display a list of 
		your workspace's team members. You can start typing names or email addresses and hit your \'enter\'
		key to autocomplete. You can also add new people, who aren't on your team, by entering their email
		address. You can send the content to yourself to approve if you wish.
5. 	Click \'Send\' to assign the content for approval to the people you've selected. Any new people to your
		team will be sent a team invite, but can approve right away.
6.	A confirmation screen will display, showing you who you've asked to approve the content. If you've missed
		anyone you can repeat steps 3, 4, and 5, adding the people you missed in step 4.

**Tip**: We recommend only having one approver of your content. This should
be the person who is ultimately accountable for published content.

To approve content:

1.	Everyone asked to review the content will receive a request email.
2.	Click the \'Approve\' button in the email or copy any paste the secure URL into your chosen web browser.
		The URL in the email expires after 3 days. If you miss that deadline, you can hit reply and send an email
		asking for a new request from the content owner.
3.	You'll be securely logged into CS Workflow and the content you've been asked to approve will load.
4.	Click the \'Approve\' button in the top-middle of the screen.
5.	When all approvers have approved the content it will move to Ready. The approvals are tracked to the content version
		and can be viewed in the Approval tab in the Content section.

If the content has issues and can't be approve:

1. 	Give your feedback by [making comments](/help/comments/make-comments.html). You can highlight sections 
		of the text or the content to make inline comments. You can also make general comments or reply to other comments.
2.	When you've finished identifying the issues with the content, click the \'Submit feedback\' button in
		top-middle of the screen.
3.	The content goes straight to the Edit stage even if other approvers haven't approved yet.
