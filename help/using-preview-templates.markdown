Anyone is able to preview content using a preview template as long as the
[template has been added to the content](/help/content/add-preview-template-to-content.html)
you want to preview.

The content displays using the added preview template when in a read-only workflow stage (all stages except draft and edit)
or when a workspace admin clicks the Preview option in a content items More menu.
