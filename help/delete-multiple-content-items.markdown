Only admins or assigned editors are able to delete multiple content
items.

You can delete multiple content items using one of two ways:



* Go to Content and click on Content tab.
* Go to Content, click on the Categories tab and select a category from
  the list.

For either of these options:

1.  Check the checkboxes of the content items you want to delete.
2.  Click the \'Selected\' button and select \'Delete\' from the drop
    down.
3.  Confirm that you want to delete these items.

Caution: The deletion of content items is a permanent action; items
cannot be retrieved once deleted.
