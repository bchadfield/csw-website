Only admins are able to delete content.

Deleting a content item permanently removes the content, its versions
and comments from your workspace. This is an irreversible action.

As there is no limit to the number of content items a workspace can
store, we recommend archiving content that is no longer progressing
through the workflow, e.g. published or stalled content.

To delete content:

1.  Open the content item you
    want to delete.
2.  Click on the \'Actions\' button at the top of the content box and select \'Delete\' from the dropdown.
3.  Confirm you want to delete
    the content.

The content item, its versions and comments are now permanently deleted
from your workspace.
