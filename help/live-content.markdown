The Live stage is the final stage of the workflow and indicates that the
content has been approved and is now published. There are some scenarios
where content is not published, for example support email templates, so
the Live stage can also be used to show the content is complete and in
use.

Only admins can manually move ready content to Live.

The following export options are available to content in the Ready
stage:

* [Export](/help/content/export-content.html) to Markdown, HTML, or plain text.
* Publish to an [integrated platform](/help/integrations/).

Content that has gone live can also be moved back to the Draft stage if
updates or changes are required. Putting live content into Draft moves
it back to the start of the workflow and saves it as a new version.
