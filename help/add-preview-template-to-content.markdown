[Preview templates](/help/preview-templates/create-preview-templates.html) allow
team members to see what the content will look like when it is live.

Only admins are able to add preview templates to content.

You can add preview templates to [content items during creation](/help/content/create-content.html).

To add a preview template to existing content:

1.  Open the content item in question.
2.  Click on the Actions button.
3.  Select Add preview template. This will bring up the Edit form.
4.  Select the preview template you want to use from the preview template drop down.
    There are some default templates. Any [preview templates you have created](/help/preview-templates/create-preview-templates.html)
    will be shown in the dropdown.
5.  Click Save.

The content will now use the preview template when in a read-only workflow stage (all stages except draft and edit)
or when a workspace admin clicks the Preview option in a content items More menu.
