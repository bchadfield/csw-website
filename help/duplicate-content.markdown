Duplicating content is an easy way to copy a content item.

Only admins and editors are able to duplicate content.

To duplicate a content item:



1.  Open the content item you want to duplicate.
2.  Click the \'Actions\' button at the top of the content box
3.  Select \'Duplicate\' from the drop down.

The page will reload and you\'ll be looking at a copy of the content.
The category and content type attribute values will also be duplicated
and \'copy\' added the content\'s name. The duplicate\'s version is
reset to v1.
