There are two parts to reviewing content: sending content for review and completing a review.
Sending content for review is how to gather feedback in CS Workflow. Only an admin can 
send content for review.

To send content for review:

1.  Navigate to the content you want reviewed.
2.  Click the workflow button that sits in the top-middle of the screen. This will dropdown to
		display all the workflow stages.
3. 	Click \'Review\' and the review form will pop up.
4.	The review form's entry field acts like the To field in email. Click it to display a list of 
		your workspace's team members. You can start typing names or email addresses and hit your \'enter\'
		key to autocomplete. You can also add new people, who aren't on your team, by entering their email
		address. You can send the content to yourself to review if you wish.
5. 	Click \'Send\' to assign the content for review to the people you've selected. Any new people to your
		team will be sent a team invite, but can start reviewing right away.
6.	A confirmation screen will display, showing you who you've asked to review the content. If you've missed
		anyone you can repeat steps 3, 4, and 5, adding the people you missed in step 4.

To complete a review:

1.	Everyone asked to review the content will receive a request email.
2.	Click the \'Review\' button in the email or copy any paste the secure URL into your chosen web browser.
		The URL in the email expires after 3 days. If you miss that deadline, you can hit reply and send an email
		asking for a new request from the content owner.
3.	You'll be securely logged into CS Workflow and the content you've been asked to review will load.
4. 	Give your feedback by [making comments](/help/comments/make-comments.html). You can highlight sections 
		of the text or the content to make inline comments. You can also make general comments or reply to other comments.
5.	When you've finished reviewing the content and have given all your feedback, click the \'Finish review\' button in
		top-middle of the screen.

**Tip:** You don't have to finish your review in one sitting. You can close the browser window and click the \'Review\'
button to reload the content. If the link expires before you've finished you can request a new one from the content owner.


Content moves to the Edit stage when all reviewers have finished. Also, all feedback for that
version is collated and sent to the content owner in a single email. The content owner can then 
edit in their chosen writing tool or use CS Workflow directly.

An admin can manually move the content back to the edit stage, if required.
