Only admins are able to create content items. The person who
creates a content item is also know as the content owner.

The content owner is assumed to
be responsible for taking their content through the workflow.

You may want to transfer ownership of a content item to another team
member. This person will then become the new content owner and
responsible for managing the content through the workflow.

Only admins are able to transfer content ownership.

To transfer ownership of a content item:

1.  Open the content item in question.
2.  Click the \'Actions\' button at the top of the content box and select
    \'Transfer ownership\' from the dropdown.
3.  The team members who are eligible to become the content owner will appear
    in the drop down. Only team members who are admins are eligible
    to be content owners. A notice will tell you if there are no eligible team
    members.
4.  Select the team member you wish to transfer ownership to.
5.  Click \'Transfer\' to save your selection.

The new content owner will notified by email of the transfer.
