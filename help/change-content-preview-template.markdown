Only admins are able to change content settings.

To change a content\'s preview template:

1.  Open the content item you wish to change.
2.  If the content doesn\'t currently have a preview template, click the
    Actions button and select Add preview template. If the
    content already has a preview template click the Actions button
    and select Edit.
3.  Select the preview template you want from the drop down. If you
    select the blank field this will remove the preview template.
4.  Click Save.

The content will now use the preview template when in a read-only workflow stage (all stages except draft and edit)
or when a workspace admin clicks the Preview option in a content items More menu.
