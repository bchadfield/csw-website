You can revert your content to a previous version. Reverting returns the content body and
content type attributes to those in the selected version.

Only admins can revert content to a previous version.

To revert to your content:

1.  Open the content item you want to revert.
2.  Click on the Versions tab on the right side of the screen.
3.  Click the \'revert\' link of the version you want to revert to. Confirm
    that is what you want to do.

The current content and content type values are automatically [saved as a new version](/help/content/save-content-as-new-version.html).
The content will take on the content body and any content attributes of the version being reverted to.

The version number will be incremented; it will not be the same as the
version number reverted to.
