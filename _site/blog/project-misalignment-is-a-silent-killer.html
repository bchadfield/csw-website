			<p>I know, I know. The actual content strategy work is so much fun. It’s easy to get caught up in audits, modeling, governing, and all that sexy stuff. However, don’t forget to invest a lot of time into the alignment portion of things. Regardless of project size, you’ll want to be sure to cover all of your stakeholder and user requirements.</p>

<p>It gets awkward if you don’t. Like <em>horrible first-date-kind of awkward</em>.</p>

<p>Project scope creep and poor management might not be a content strategy-specific ailment (projects go wrong all of the time), but given that content strategists are stewards of cooperation between organizations, content, and the people they serve, we’re in a position to prevent these nasty things more than anyone else on the team.</p>

<h3 id="discovery-phase-much">Discovery phase much?</h3>
<p>All of the champions of content strategy (including YOU) all stress the importance of aligning EVERYONE’s expectations with a content project. If there’s any one phase to spend a lot of time on, it’s the Discovery/Alignment phase. Of course, clients don’t want to spend money on that portion of the project– they often want to get into the nitty gritty.</p>

<p>As a professional content wrangler, it’s your duty to show them the right way. If they resist, here’s a little story to tell them about why the discovery and alignment phase is so important.</p>

<p>That said, let me tell you a story about a software development project that I’m still struggling with.</p>

<p>We knew our objectives from a software standpoint, but not from what our partner (distributor) wanted in regards to a solution to hit the market. At least, we thought we knew what they wanted. We even flew out of town to their offices to do some in-person interview to make sure.</p>

<p><strong>We did everything “right”</strong>: stakeholder research, user research, modeled the UI and content to those insights, crafted a user experience for the software solution to solve for the organizational goals. We even went as far as to create recommendations</p>

<p>However, something was lost in the mix. We and our partner fell out of alignment with our project at some point. Without giving away any confidential details, we basically built what we thought they wanted. What they wanted shifted as life (and business) happened, as staff members, project expectations, and launch dates moved around.</p>

<p>A year later, we’re somewhat on track towards completing this software project, but not without countless hours of inefficiencies, hurt feelings, and face-palming. This takes quite a toll on the bottom line, including losing out on opportunity with all the extra time that we had to spend to keep the project going.</p>

<h3 id="so-how-do-we-avoid-all-of-this">So, how do we avoid all of this?</h3>
<p>Make the Alignment phase as productive and thorough as possible.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DON’T BE AFRAID TO SPEAK UP:</strong> Relying on the Project Manager or the project gods to favor you is not the best idea. Content strategists have the luxury of referring to the objectives of both users and the organization. We have the data to recommend adjustments to the project in order to keep everyone’s best interests in play. Ask all of the questions that you need to. Don’t be shy, don’t hold back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DON’T BE AFRAID TO AMEND THE PROJECT SPECIFICATION OR PLAN IF NEEDED:</strong> Suggesting changes to the project timeline or plan doesn’t show weakness, it shows flexibility and the drive to accomplish the task at hand. You’ll only get to this point if there are drastic parts of the project that require the extra time or resources. Addressing it sooner than later makes all the difference.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>NOT ALL OF US CAN TIME-TRAVEL, SO MAKE THE MOST OF THE DISCOVERY PROCESS WHEN YOU GET THE CHANCE:</strong> <a href="http://www.kevinpnichols.com/2012/10/kevin_p_nichols.html" target="_blank">Kevin P. Nichols has a fantastic stakeholder questionnaire</a> that every content strategist should employ during their next big project. It’s not bulletproof, but it’s a great place to start building your stakeholder research during that all-important discovery phase. He tells readers something along the same lines as this article– take more time to complete this than you think you need.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="a-story-somewhat-a-solution-and-a-request">A story, somewhat a solution, and a request.</h3>
<p>No excuses now! You have my rough, embarrassing content/software project nightmare to share with your clients and a few tips and resources to make your next stakeholder alignment phase a magical, useful one.</p>

<p>Go ahead an exaggerate the story as much as you want to. Kick it off with something like, “Oh boy, one time I heard about this person’s content project nightmare that went a little something like this…”</p>

<p>You’re well-equipped now, adventurer. Make the most of your stakeholder research and alignment sessions and slay all project creep that comes your way.</p>
