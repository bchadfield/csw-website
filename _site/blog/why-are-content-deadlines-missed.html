			<p>Over the last few days I've been researching different ways people setup
and manage editorial calendars.A theme that came up again and again was that publishing deadlines are
being treated like guidelines. Strangely content is not expected to go
live on time and there's little urgency or anxiety about it being
delayed.</p>

<p>It shouldn't be like that. The
longer content takes to go live the more it costs, reducing ROI. Every
day that your content is delayed is another day that people are looking
for it but can't find it. Or worse, they find it elsewhere.</p>

<p>Every piece of content that goes live is its own mini project. It
suffers from the same problems as any project does: poor initial
scheduling, lack of co-ordination, resourcing issues, changing scope,
etc. Web content comes with its own special set of problems. Let's look
at some of those problems and how to stop them messing with your
deadlines.</p>

<h3 id="written-content-isnt-published-content">Written content isn't published content</h3>

<p>One common cause of delays is forgetting that writing isn't the end of
the road. After the writing is finished there's still layout, marking
up, media wrangling, uploading and testing to do before any 'publish'
buttons can be clicked.</p>

<p>Failing to acknowledge the publishing work means you'll have content
signed off, but still be hours or days (depending on your resources)
from going live. It's easy to do, especially if you're the person who
takes care of developing the content for publishing.</p>

<p>The solution is simply to take publishing time into consideration. Make
sure your author's deadlines aren't the same as your publishing
deadlines. Brief authors with enough time to get drafts submitted.</p>

<h3 id="bad-briefs">Bad briefs</h3>

<p>Speaking of briefs, bad briefs are a waste of time. If you're working
with external authors briefs are the main way that content plans are
communicated. Briefs setup a source of truth for any future
disagreements about deliverables. Bad briefs cause confusion and are
more likely to lead to disagreements. There are three causes of bad
briefs.</p>

<p>The first cause is people trying to save themselves time by cutting
corners on the brief, assuming the writer will be able to fill in the
gaps. What often ends up happening is they spending more time answering
questions from the writer than they saved. Or worse, the writer goes
ahead and the work produced is not what was wanted. Then it's back to
square one.</p>

<p>The second cause of bad briefs is that writing briefs is an
underestimated skill. People who don't come from a writing background
need to develop this skill. This can be related to the first reason.
People cut corners because they don't understand the impact of the gaps
they are leaving.</p>

<p>When starting out with a new writer reverse briefs can be a good way to
make sure everyone is on the same page. Reverse briefs are where the
author explains what they are going to write.</p>

<p>The third is that the content isn't ready to be briefed. There needs to
be enough ground work done on the content to be able to create a
thorough brief. Time pressures and an unclear strategy are often behind
a brief that is sparse on detail and vague in its vision.</p>

<p>Briefs are communication. Good communication solves almost every problem
by providing clarity.</p>

<h3 id="no-workflow">No workflow</h3>

<p>In case you're not sure about what a workflow is: a content workflow is
a detailed plan of how content progresses through its lifecycle, who is
responsible for each stage, and the rules for adapting to whatever needs
to be adapted to. The level of detail in the workflow depends on the
organisation and how they work with content. Having a planned workflow
lays out clear expectations of everyone involved.</p>

<p>Most teams don't have a workflow. Instead, they have a set of
undocumented rules, like the Marketing Manager must sign off, which are
passed down verbally through the generations. This works. Content gets
published regularly. But getting there is harder than it needs to be.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">Not having a workflow is like
racing full speed between traffic lights. You'll feel like your moving
quickly, but really you're spending most of the time stuck waiting to
move. The trip takes longer, is more frustrating, and burns more
fuel.</span></p>

<p>Continuing the metaphor, creating a workflow involves looking for the
obstacles that slow traffic and working out ahead of time how to deal
with them. In Ideal Land obstacles are avoided altogether. At the very
least you'll know who to contact to get a green light.</p>
