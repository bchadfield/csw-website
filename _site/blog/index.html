	      <div class="post-meta">By <a href="https://twitter.com/benchadfield" target="_blank">Ben Chadfield</a> - 15 October 2014</div>
	      <div class="post-content"><p>It's been a long time since you've heard any news from us. Maybe you
thought that we'd slipped quietly away. We haven't. In fact, we've
been working really hard to make sure CS Workflow keeps the promise of
making your content workflow easier.</p>

<p>After launch we could see that our tool wasn't good enough. The biggest
problem was that we'd made accessing content more difficult for
reviewers. They had a new system that came with a perceived learning
curve and passwords they had to remember. This meant that content
wasn't getting reviewed and approved as hoped through CS Workflow. Not
a great start.</p>

<p>We stopped our marketing efforts to work exclusively on meeting our
promise and making improvements. You're not supposed to do that. All
advise was to keep selling, but we didn't feel good about pushing a
tool that we weren't proud of.</p>

<p>We're really happy with the latest batch of changes and now it's time
to start talking about them. These improvements are all available for
you to check out today.</p>

<p>Here’s a short video that shows off what we’ve done.</p>

<div class="video-container">
	<iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/hGAfuKmGDVo?vq=hd1080" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<h3 id="new-design-for-the-content-page">New design for the content page</h3>

<p>The new content page is the most visible change we’ve made. The review
and approval view is very simple with the options and information
stripped right back. The new design puts the focus on the content and
providing feedback. This makes it much easier for reviewers to jump
right in and get started.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/new-content-process/new-content-design.png" alt="New content page design" /></p>

<h3 id="no-sign-in">No sign in</h3>

<p>The new request email sent to reviewers and approvers includes a secure
URL to the content. Clicking the URL securely logs them in and takes
them directly to the content you want them to look at. To keep the URL
safe there is an expiry time, which is currently 3 days. A new request
can be sent if the old one expires.</p>

<h3 id="easier-to-send-requests">Easier to send requests</h3>

<p>Speaking of sending requests, we've made that a whole lot easier. You
set who the request goes to exactly like the 'To' field of an email.
Like email you can send review and approval requests to anyone with an
email address. If you send a request to someone new to the team, they
are added and can jump straight in to reviewing content. It's optional
for them to setup their account and password.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/new-content-process/send-for-review.png" alt="Easily send content for review" /></p>

<h3 id="no-more-complicated-roles">No more complicated roles</h3>

<p>There's only one role and that's admin. What you are able to do is
based on what you've been asked to do. If you've been asked to review
content, you are a reviewer for that content. Same goes for approving.
Admins are the only team members who can add content. They also manage
the workspace, including content types and preview templates. Everybody
else has read-only access to content in the workspace.</p>

<h3 id="more-previewing-options">More previewing options</h3>

<p>There are now default preview templates to support the default content
types. The most popular content type is blog, making up nearly 70% of
the content put through CS Workflow. Email is just over 15%. The new
design of the content page puts more emphasis on previewing the content.
We've added basic templates for all three default content types, which
are blog, email and tweet. You don't need to add a preview template,
simply add a blog content type to your content and it'll display like a
basic blog with title, author and published date. This makes all the
difference to reviewers who can preview the content.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/new-content-process/blog-preview-template.png" alt="Default blog preview template" /></p>

<h3 id="managing-your-sent-requests">Managing your sent requests</h3>

<p>We've updated how you keep track of what stage our content is in and
who is working on it. You can see who is actively involved, who has
completed your requests, and how long ago you asked them to review. You
can also resend requests to any stragglers who are holding up your
content.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/new-content-process/resend-request.png" alt="Easily resend a review request" /></p>

<p>We'd love to hear what you think about the changes. Did we miss
anything you were hoping for? What other changes help you get good
feedback from your reviewers?</p>

	    	<h2><a href="/blog/why-are-content-deadlines-missed.html">Why are content deadlines missed?</a></h2>
	      <div class="post-meta">By <a href="https://twitter.com/benchadfield" target="_blank">Ben Chadfield</a> - 27 June 2014</div>
	      <div class="post-content"><p>Over the last few days I've been researching different ways people setup
and manage editorial calendars.A theme that came up again and again was that publishing deadlines are
being treated like guidelines. Strangely content is not expected to go
live on time and there's little urgency or anxiety about it being
delayed.</p>

<p>It shouldn't be like that. The
longer content takes to go live the more it costs, reducing ROI. Every
day that your content is delayed is another day that people are looking
for it but can't find it. Or worse, they find it elsewhere.</p>

<p>Every piece of content that goes live is its own mini project. It
suffers from the same problems as any project does: poor initial
scheduling, lack of co-ordination, resourcing issues, changing scope,
etc. Web content comes with its own special set of problems. Let's look
at some of those problems and how to stop them messing with your
deadlines.</p>

<h3 id="written-content-isnt-published-content">Written content isn't published content</h3>

<p>One common cause of delays is forgetting that writing isn't the end of
the road. After the writing is finished there's still layout, marking
up, media wrangling, uploading and testing to do before any 'publish'
buttons can be clicked.</p>

<p>Failing to acknowledge the publishing work means you'll have content
signed off, but still be hours or days (depending on your resources)
from going live. It's easy to do, especially if you're the person who
takes care of developing the content for publishing.</p>

<p>The solution is simply to take publishing time into consideration. Make
sure your author's deadlines aren't the same as your publishing
deadlines. Brief authors with enough time to get drafts submitted.</p>

<h3 id="bad-briefs">Bad briefs</h3>

<p>Speaking of briefs, bad briefs are a waste of time. If you're working
with external authors briefs are the main way that content plans are
communicated. Briefs setup a source of truth for any future
disagreements about deliverables. Bad briefs cause confusion and are
more likely to lead to disagreements. There are three causes of bad
briefs.</p>

<p>The first cause is people trying to save themselves time by cutting
corners on the brief, assuming the writer will be able to fill in the
gaps. What often ends up happening is they spending more time answering
questions from the writer than they saved. Or worse, the writer goes
ahead and the work produced is not what was wanted. Then it's back to
square one.</p>

<p>The second cause of bad briefs is that writing briefs is an
underestimated skill. People who don't come from a writing background
need to develop this skill. This can be related to the first reason.
People cut corners because they don't understand the impact of the gaps
they are leaving.</p>

<p>When starting out with a new writer reverse briefs can be a good way to
make sure everyone is on the same page. Reverse briefs are where the
author explains what they are going to write.</p>

<p>The third is that the content isn't ready to be briefed. There needs to
be enough ground work done on the content to be able to create a
thorough brief. Time pressures and an unclear strategy are often behind
a brief that is sparse on detail and vague in its vision.</p>

<p>Briefs are communication. Good communication solves almost every problem
by providing clarity.</p>

<h3 id="no-workflow">No workflow</h3>

<p>In case you're not sure about what a workflow is: a content workflow is
a detailed plan of how content progresses through its lifecycle, who is
responsible for each stage, and the rules for adapting to whatever needs
to be adapted to. The level of detail in the workflow depends on the
organisation and how they work with content. Having a planned workflow
lays out clear expectations of everyone involved.</p>

<p>Most teams don't have a workflow. Instead, they have a set of
undocumented rules, like the Marketing Manager must sign off, which are
passed down verbally through the generations. This works. Content gets
published regularly. But getting there is harder than it needs to be.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">Not having a workflow is like
racing full speed between traffic lights. You'll feel like your moving
quickly, but really you're spending most of the time stuck waiting to
move. The trip takes longer, is more frustrating, and burns more
fuel.</span></p>

<p>Continuing the metaphor, creating a workflow involves looking for the
obstacles that slow traffic and working out ahead of time how to deal
with them. In Ideal Land obstacles are avoided altogether. At the very
least you'll know who to contact to get a green light.</p>

	      <div class="post-meta">By <a href="https://twitter.com/benchadfield" target="_blank">Ben Chadfield</a> - 17 June 2014</div>
	      <div class="post-content"><p>An undead blog looks alive from a distance, but because of circumstances
'out of your control', your blog is actually dead. Once upon a time
your blog was loved. You brought it into this world after all. Every now
and then you hear of its cries for attention and feed it fresh posts,
but you know, deep down, that's not enough.</p>

<p>For the undead metaphor to work you should think of a staggering monster
that either sucks your life force or consumes your brains. Teetering on
the edge of life and death, its need for sustenance is all consuming and
it will drag you down if you let it.</p>

<p>There are very <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/insiders/inbound-marketing-stats">good reasons why you have a blog</a>. Maybe you've
forgotten, so here's a couple of reminders:</p>

<ul>
  <li>blogs give websites 434% more indexed pages and 97% more indexed links</li>
  <li>B2B companies that blog generate 67% more leads per month than those
that don’t</li>
</ul>

<p>It's possible that the introduction of this post gives the impression
that there's some secret way to bring a blog back from the undead
(I'll let you imagine your own intricate moonlight ceremony).</p>

<p>Really there's no secret and you know what you're supposed to do: <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2012/10/22/why-content-marketing-is-the-new-seo/">add new content more often</a>.</p>

<p>Your blog needs new posts regularly, but you aren't going to write it
or you would be already. Here comes the point: you should get someone
else to blog for you.</p>

<p>So far this has been all about you and how you're neglecting your blog.
Really this is about us at CS Workflow. Our blog has been live for
nearly a year and this post will be our first non-product update since
the new year. There has been a lot going on, which is why I know how
easy it is let the blog slide and focus on my 'real job'.</p>

<p>When I was a Marketing Director in a previous life, I was suddenly
without an in-house writer. I wanted to keep our content marketing going
by engaging an agency. This is when I found Kathryn Hawkins, a principal
of the content marketing agency <a href="http://eucalyptmedia.com/">Eucalypt Media</a>. It seemed fitting
to get her input into this post.</p>

<p>Below Kathryn answers some of the questions I had back then about how to
hire a freelance writer. There are some topics raised that are posts of
their own, but this is a solid place to start.</p>

<h4 id="what-questions-should-buyers-ask-when-first-contacting-a-freelancer">What questions should buyers ask when first contacting a freelancer?</h4>

<p>Ask to see writing samples, and testimonials from satisfied clients
(LinkedIn is often a good source of those). Also, make sure to find out
about the writer's overall process in terms of collaborating with you
and what's provided in terms of revisions. By making sure you're on
the same page, you can make sure the engagement runs smoothly from start
to finish.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-main-things-a-buyer-should-look-for-in-a-freelancer">What are the main things a buyer should look for in a freelancer?</h4>

<p>Buyers of content marketing services should seek out writers or agencies
with experience writing about similar industries—they don't need to be
<em>exactly</em> the same (after all, most businesses want to believe their
solutions are unique!), but the writer's experience should demonstrate
that they can easily grasp new concepts and industry terminology. It's
also very helpful if your writer has a background in journalism rather
than pure corporate communications — it means s/he'll be able to find
the real story in what you're selling.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-some-red-flags">What are some red flags?</h4>

<p>Rates far below the norm typically mean that the writer isn't
experienced, and, as a result, you're not likely to get a
professional-quality piece of content. It's also a worry if the writer
wants to bill hourly, but isn't willing to give you any sort of
estimate for how long the project might take—insist on a milestone-based
approach in that case, or you could end up with <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sticker+shock" target="_blank">sticker shock</a>.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-common-fee-structures-for-freelancers">What are the common fee structures for freelancers?</h4>

<p>Fee structures can range depending on the project and how your writer or
agency prefers to work. For an article or blog post, a per-word fee or a
flat rate for a set word range (i.e. 400-500 words) is fairly common.
For a more research-based project like a content audit, an hourly rate
is generally preferable, though most content strategists will provide
you with a ballpark estimate of what the project will cost. Retainers
are also great for clients with regular, dependable needs — we recommend
retainer packages to many of our clients, as it helps them make sure
that we have the resources to prioritize their projects, and they can
keep their budgets predictable. You can find out more about content
marketing retainer packages <a href="http://eucalyptmedia.com/blog/entry/why-choose-a-content-marketing-retainer-package">in this blog post.</a></p>

<h4 id="what-is-the-range-in-common-fee-structures">What is the range in common fee structures?</h4>

<p>Fees vary wildly depending on the writer or agency, and the work
involved. You can find people to write articles for as little as $5 for
a few hundred words—but I would strongly recommend against it. To
spotlight your company in its best light, you need to find highly
qualified writers who can quickly gain a solid understanding of your
industry. Depending on the type of project involved, rates for
professional writers typically vary from $0.50 to $2 per word, or $75 to
$150 per hour.</p>

<h4 id="are-there-additional-costs-a-buyer-should-be-aware-of">Are there additional costs a buyer should be aware of?</h4>

<p>In most cases, you should factor photography and/or graphic design into
your marketing budget—many agencies will handle this along with the
content, though if you're working with an individual writer, you may
need to contract with a designer. If you simply need an image to
accompany a blog post, licensing a stock photo is often an easy and
affordable choice; however, if you are developing a more comprehensive
piece, such as an ebook or white paper, it may be worth investing in
graphic design services for a professional feel.</p>

<p>Also, in some cases, the buyer might want to add new information or
dramatically change the outline—if you've already agreed to a fee with
your writer, you will likely need to renegotiate at this stage. Most
writers or agencies commit to a rate based on a specific set of
deliverables, so if you change your mind once s/he's gotten started,
the fee will change as well.</p>

<h4 id="if-a-business-wants-to-blog-weekly-what-budget-should-they-assign-for-a-retainer">If a business wants to blog weekly, what budget should they assign for a retainer?</h4>

<p>At minimum, a business should budget $800 or so per month for weekly
posts, though more if the company wants the writer to help with
promotional efforts as well. A well-written and informative post each
week can help the business grow its traffic and readership, and can
serve as valuable content to use in social marketing and email marketing
pushes.</p>

<p>With an annual expense of around $10,000, this is much cheaper than
hiring a full-time employee (especially one with the level of experience
your writer will likely have), and can provide significant return on
investment through new leads generated from the content.</p>

<p>As an added bonus, it is generally easy to scale up or scale down such
an engagement, which is impossible for a full-time staff member.</p>

	      <div class="post-meta">By <a href="https://twitter.com/vclaringbull" target="_blank">Vicky Claringbull</a> - 14 May 2014</div>
	      <div class="post-content"><p>CS Workflow has launched! We’re now taking sign ups through the website.</p>

<p>We launched the beta 5 months ago, which feels like just yesterday. In that time we’ve had amazing feedback and support. Thank you everyone who took the time to check out CS Workflow and a special thanks to everyone that gave us feedback.</p>

<h2 id="plans-and-pricing">Plans and pricing</h2>
<p>We’ve created three generous plans: Freelancer, Agency and Team.</p>

<p>Choosing the right plan depends on who approves and reviews your content</p>

<p>If you work with different people on different pieces of content (e.g. multiple clients), the right plan depends on the size of the approval teams you work with.</p>

<p>If you only have a couple of approvers: the Freelancer plan is for you.</p>

<p>More people than that: the Agency plan is what you’ll need.</p>

<p>If all your content usually goes through the same reviewers and approvers: the Team plan is the way to go.</p>

<h3 id="freelancer">Freelancer</h3>
<p><em>FREE</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Up to 5 workspaces (each workspace supports 1 client or team)</li>
  <li>Up to 3 users per workspace</li>
  <li>Unlimited content, content types, preview templates, and integrations</li>
</ul>

<p>The user limit allows for you to have a reviewer and an approver in your client’s company.</p>

<h3 id="team">Team</h3>
<p><em>$65 per month</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>1 workspace for your team</li>
  <li>Unlimited users</li>
  <li>Unlimited content, content types, preview templates, and integrations</li>
</ul>

<p>On the Team plan there’s no restriction on team size, so you can include as many people as you need. One workspace will be able to handle the content needs of your whole team.</p>

<h3 id="agency">Agency</h3>
<p><em>$245 per month</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Unlimited workspaces (each workspace supports 1 client or team)</li>
  <li>Unlimited users per workspace</li>
  <li>Unlimited content, content types, preview templates, and integrations</li>
</ul>

<p>With the Agency plan you have the ability to set up workspaces for each of your clients. Each workspace is a secure area meaning clients won’t be able to see each other’s content.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next</h2>
<p>We’re really happy with how CS Workflow solves the problem of content reviews and approvals. But that is just the start. We’ll be adding support for more publishing platforms and covering more areas of the content workflow.</p>

	    	<h2><a href="/blog/version-control-and-docx-imports.html">Version control and docx imports</a></h2>
	      <div class="post-meta">By <a href="https://twitter.com/vclaringbull" target="_blank">Vicky Claringbull</a> - 06 March 2014</div>
	      <div class="post-content"><p>The great news is that your feedback keeps rolling in and we’ve been kept busy trying to keep up with it. Here are some of the changes we’ve made to improve your CS Workflow experience:</p>

<h3 id="version-control">Version control</h3>
<p>You’ve always been able to save content as a new version but now you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>view your content’s past versions;</li>
  <li>compare any two versions; and</li>
  <li>revert to a past version.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will never lose your content again and you’ll be able to keep track of what changes have been made.</p>

<h3 id="docx-file-import">Docx file import</h3>
<p>CS Workflow now allows for the uploading of docx files. This function will support basic formatting including bold, italic, underline and headings.</p>

<p>Content imports are available in the draft or edit stages. The file imports to the main editing area only (other content attributes are not updated).</p>

<h3 id="csw-bot">CSW bot</h3>
<p>It’s now possible to road test CS Workflow without the need to set up a team. The CSW bot is a virtual team member who can review and approve content.</p>

<p>To enable this function, go to the Overview, click ‘Get some guidance’ located in the top alert notice, then click the link to check out the workflow by yourself. This will add a bot user that will respond to your requests.</p>

<p>Any communications sent to the bot will also be sent to you allowing you to see what happens at the recipient’s end.</p>

<h3 id="wordpress-post-editing-from-cs-workflow">Wordpress post editing from CS Workflow</h3>
<p>CS Workflow currently allows you to publish directly to your Wordpress blog. We’ve improved this by enabling you to edit and update your blog once it’s live. Exporting approved changes to content already exported to Wordpress will update the post rather than create a new post. This will support any changes including changing the scheduled publish time.</p>

<h3 id="coming-up">Coming up…</h3>
<p>The feature currently being developed is in-context previewing. Team members will be able to get a better understanding of what the content will look like when it is live.</p>

<p>To do this, CS Workflow will be supporting uploaded templates (HTML, CSS). We will provide some default preview templates for things like social updates and ads that have common styles and layouts.</p>

	      <div class="post-meta">By <a href="https://twitter.com/vclaringbull" target="_blank">Vicky Claringbull</a> - 12 February 2014</div>
	      <div class="post-content"><p>2014 is going to be a busy year for CS Workflow. We’ve started this year continuing where we left off, by improving and building towards our official launch in a few months. Keep you eyes open for more news about our launch as we’ll be rewarding our early adopters with a special introductory offer.</p>

<p>Here’s an update about what changes we’ve made recently and what to expect in the coming weeks.</p>

<h3 id="publishing-to-wordpress">Publishing to Wordpress</h3>
<p>We’re building CS Workflow to be the best and easiest way to get your content reviewed and approved. From the start we knew that the key to making it a useful part of your whole content process was connecting to other platforms and applications.</p>

<p>The first platform we are supporting is Wordpress. This integration will allow you to export your approved content to Wordpress when it is ready to go live. Setup is straightforward. Go to the Integrations tab in Settings, add a new Wordpress integration and simply enter your blog’s URL. A new option will be available in your content export dropdown. The Wordpress export supports several options, including author, category and scheduled publishing.</p>

<p>Read the article about <a href="http://csworkflow.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/305936-exporting-to-wordpress" target="_blank">exporting to Wordpress</a> for more information about setup and exporting options.</p>

<p>More integration options will be coming soon.</p>

<h3 id="email-notification-preferences">Email notification preferences</h3>
<p>You now have control over the notification emails you receive from CS Workflow. You can set whether you want to receive the alerts immediately, as part of your daily activity digest, or not at all.</p>

<p>Email notification preferences can be set for comments on content you own, replies to your comments, workflow updates for content you are assigned to, and requests for you to edit, review or approve content.</p>

<p>The default setting is to send requests immediately with all other notifications added to your daily digest. To change the default, click your user icon in the top left and then notification preferences in the menu.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s next</h3>
<p>Over the next few weeks we’ll be focusing on bug fixes, improving help documentation, and completing started features.</p>

<p>The new workflow allows for distinct review and approval stages. During review, only reviewers review the content and make comments. During approval Approvers are able to submit feedback and request changes.</p>

<h3 id="more-flexibility">More flexibility</h3>
<p>Admin and Editors now have more powers to move content through the workflow. At any time prior to the Ready stage, content can be moved around the workflow to any stage. For example, content can go straight to approval from edit, thereby skipping the review stage. This new flexibility allows you to change up the workflow depending on your content and business needs. CS Workflow assists you to minimise the risks of publishing content and won’t allow any content to move to Ready until it has been approved.</p>

<h3 id="new-workflow-stage-dropdown">New workflow stage dropdown</h3>
<p>A new dropdown button has been added to content pages. Users can access the dropdown to find out what stage content is in. The dropdown will also indicate to editors and admin what stages the content can to moved to. For example, content that is in the draft stage can to moved to Edit, Review or Approval via the dropdown.</p>

	      <div class="post-meta">By <a href="http://secretsanta.csworkflow.com/draws/2013/gifts" target="_blank">Anonymous from Blog Secret Santa</a> - 26 December 2013</div>
	      <div class="post-content"><p>I know, I know. The actual content strategy work is so much fun. It’s easy to get caught up in audits, modeling, governing, and all that sexy stuff. However, don’t forget to invest a lot of time into the alignment portion of things. Regardless of project size, you’ll want to be sure to cover all of your stakeholder and user requirements.</p>

<p>It gets awkward if you don’t. Like <em>horrible first-date-kind of awkward</em>.</p>

<p>Project scope creep and poor management might not be a content strategy-specific ailment (projects go wrong all of the time), but given that content strategists are stewards of cooperation between organizations, content, and the people they serve, we’re in a position to prevent these nasty things more than anyone else on the team.</p>

<h3 id="discovery-phase-much">Discovery phase much?</h3>
<p>All of the champions of content strategy (including YOU) all stress the importance of aligning EVERYONE’s expectations with a content project. If there’s any one phase to spend a lot of time on, it’s the Discovery/Alignment phase. Of course, clients don’t want to spend money on that portion of the project– they often want to get into the nitty gritty.</p>

<p>As a professional content wrangler, it’s your duty to show them the right way. If they resist, here’s a little story to tell them about why the discovery and alignment phase is so important.</p>

<p>That said, let me tell you a story about a software development project that I’m still struggling with.</p>

<p>We knew our objectives from a software standpoint, but not from what our partner (distributor) wanted in regards to a solution to hit the market. At least, we thought we knew what they wanted. We even flew out of town to their offices to do some in-person interview to make sure.</p>

<p><strong>We did everything “right”</strong>: stakeholder research, user research, modeled the UI and content to those insights, crafted a user experience for the software solution to solve for the organizational goals. We even went as far as to create recommendations</p>

<p>However, something was lost in the mix. We and our partner fell out of alignment with our project at some point. Without giving away any confidential details, we basically built what we thought they wanted. What they wanted shifted as life (and business) happened, as staff members, project expectations, and launch dates moved around.</p>

<p>A year later, we’re somewhat on track towards completing this software project, but not without countless hours of inefficiencies, hurt feelings, and face-palming. This takes quite a toll on the bottom line, including losing out on opportunity with all the extra time that we had to spend to keep the project going.</p>

<h3 id="so-how-do-we-avoid-all-of-this">So, how do we avoid all of this?</h3>
<p>Make the Alignment phase as productive and thorough as possible.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DON’T BE AFRAID TO SPEAK UP:</strong> Relying on the Project Manager or the project gods to favor you is not the best idea. Content strategists have the luxury of referring to the objectives of both users and the organization. We have the data to recommend adjustments to the project in order to keep everyone’s best interests in play. Ask all of the questions that you need to. Don’t be shy, don’t hold back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DON’T BE AFRAID TO AMEND THE PROJECT SPECIFICATION OR PLAN IF NEEDED:</strong> Suggesting changes to the project timeline or plan doesn’t show weakness, it shows flexibility and the drive to accomplish the task at hand. You’ll only get to this point if there are drastic parts of the project that require the extra time or resources. Addressing it sooner than later makes all the difference.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>NOT ALL OF US CAN TIME-TRAVEL, SO MAKE THE MOST OF THE DISCOVERY PROCESS WHEN YOU GET THE CHANCE:</strong> <a href="http://www.kevinpnichols.com/2012/10/kevin_p_nichols.html" target="_blank">Kevin P. Nichols has a fantastic stakeholder questionnaire</a> that every content strategist should employ during their next big project. It’s not bulletproof, but it’s a great place to start building your stakeholder research during that all-important discovery phase. He tells readers something along the same lines as this article– take more time to complete this than you think you need.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="a-story-somewhat-a-solution-and-a-request">A story, somewhat a solution, and a request.</h3>
<p>No excuses now! You have my rough, embarrassing content/software project nightmare to share with your clients and a few tips and resources to make your next stakeholder alignment phase a magical, useful one.</p>

<p>Go ahead an exaggerate the story as much as you want to. Kick it off with something like, “Oh boy, one time I heard about this person’s content project nightmare that went a little something like this…”</p>

<p>You’re well-equipped now, adventurer. Make the most of your stakeholder research and alignment sessions and slay all project creep that comes your way.</p>

	      <div class="post-meta">By <a href="https://twitter.com/vclaringbull" target="_blank">Vicky Claringbull</a> - 12 December 2013</div>
	      <div class="post-content"><p>About 4 years ago I moved to Melbourne, Australia. Not knowing my way around, I’d asked my housemate at the time the best route to get to my new work.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;">'Do you want to fastest or the easiest route?' he'd asked.</p>

<p>His response surprised me, ‘Aren’t they the same?’ I’d replied. My thinking was, surely the simplest way would be the quickest. But actually, I was wrong (as he then went on to explain). Fast did not always mean easy. Fast meant a few more turns, some insider’s knowledge and shortcuts that only a local would know about. Now, I am always happy to do a bit of learning in order to spend less time in traffic, however it reminded me of the situation we often face at work - we’d often rather follow what we consider the simplest process than do that which would be faster or more efficient.</p>

<p>For example, at my previous work, the publishing department would handle about 100,000 individual copyright and permissions requests every year. Sometimes we’d get them in hardcopy, sometimes as email attachments, word files, and even (yes, still!) via the old dusty fax machine. Whatever the format, they would all follow the same process. Any hardcopies would need to be scanned before they could be entered into our database system. There were hours of sorting, file naming and double handling that added up to a lot of frustration and wasted time. Finally after years of doing things this way, they (meaning management) decided to take action - yay! It was almost 2 years of analysing the problem and developing a bespoke solution before a new tool was developed that would radically streamline the process. And after all this do you know what it was met with? You guessed it - resistance and suspicion. It was a classic example of better the devil you know. In this case ‘easy’ meant the way we’ve always done it.</p>

<p>Humans are amazing creatures, they are able to adapt to the most insufferable conditions to the extent which they perceive those conditions to be desirable. You need only think of Stockholm syndrome. Now before you start thinking I’m comparing office workers to victims of serious crime, the point I’m trying to make is that people’s attitude to change is not always reasonable. Think about the <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/tommywilhelm/the-facebook-timeline-of-facebook-backlashes" target="_blank">huge backlash Facebook gets</a> whenever changes are announced. What is reasonable, however, is to expect some resistance, and to plan for it. I’m talking about information sessions, workshops, training and whatever else you can think to get people on board. In hindsight this is probably where my old work went wrong. People knew something was happening but it was very much in the background and it was able to be forgotten about. It’s a reminder that what matters here is to get people thinking about change; change not for the sake of change but change for better processes and efficiencies.</p>

<p>People often think they’re too busy to even contemplate stopping, observing and evaluating the cause of inefficiencies. It’s a bit like going on a diet and never weighing yourself to measure your progress - sure you might feel better being shielded from bad news but you’ve got no motivation to keep going either.</p>

<p>Measuring how good your processes are doesn’t have to be an arduous task. It could be counting how much content went live in the month or gauging the team’s energy levels and attitudes. However you choose to measure these, it’s equally important to use your results for positive change. Get your team involved and consult with those who will be affected. Set others the example of reflection, taking initiative, of problem solving and continual improvement. A work culture that denies its workers the opportunity for change is one destined to stagnate.</p>

<p>Get into the fast lane; don’t be tempted to opt for the easy route.</p>

	    	<h2><a href="/blog/are-you-really-customer-focused.html">Are you really customer focused?</a></h2>
	      <div class="post-meta">By <a href="https://twitter.com/vclaringbull" target="_blank">Vicky Claringbull</a> - 03 December 2013</div>
	      <div class="post-content"><p>I was watching QI the other night and Stephen Fry posed the age old question: if a tree falls down in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? For those of you not familiar with <a href="http://qi.com" target="_blank">QI</a>, it’s a panel show that debunks facts and and replaces them with the unlikely truth (in often full-blown hilarity). The tree in the forest got me thinking: if content goes live and no one sees it, does it actually exist? What the fallen tree and content have in common is that they both need a receiver to validate their existence. A message can only be communicated if there is an audience to engage with it. So the questions is: who is your content’s audience and are you engaging them?</p>

<p>If you’re creating content for a business then your likely audience are prospects or customers or both. This creation of content will be aimed at generating responses from the audience that help the business achieve specific outcomes, e.g. sales, brand awareness. This is a simple and well-known strategy and yet it can sometimes be lost in the panic to get content live.</p>

<p>The path to getting content live can often be a series of wrong turns and dead ends in the form of reviews and approvals. For the content creator it can be like driving a bus where all the passengers are backseat drivers, each trying to get their 2 cents in and basically telling them how to do their job. It’s no wonder then that in order to keep the peace and get to point B the content creator deviates from their original route. Overloaded copywriters (and what copywriters aren’t these days) can make massive concessions to reviewers and approvers to keep content moving towards the go live deadline. In some organisations this can even be a normal and expected part of the content process. In this context it’s easy to see how the content’s audience can be forgotten in favour of appeasing a business’ internal stakeholders, aka those pesky backseat drivers. And don’t think that this problem is limited to in-house content creators. Freelancers and agencies can also get caught in the trap of treating their clients as the audience.</p>

<p>This problem is really down to having non-cohesive processes and unclear business priorities. Common goals and a collective understanding of them should lie at the heart of a business’ content strategy. Halvorsen &amp; Rach place the business’ core strategy at the centre of their <a href="http://blog.braintraffic.com/2011/03/brain_traffic_lands_quad/" target="_blank">content strategy quad</a>. It is that which guides all initiatives and decision making. It is clearly also a great way of getting people on board. Want to know why we need to get this content live? Because it ties in closely to the business’ goal of building their industry reputation. Want to know why you need to look at this now? Because this content is aimed at increasing sales before the next financial quarter.</p>

<p>Fantastic, so you’ve got people looking at the content when you need them to. It’s a good start but it’s not going to guarantee you create great content. Halvorsen &amp; Rach remind us that one of the most important concepts behind their content strategy quad is the interplay between the five areas of substance, structure, workflow, governance and core strategy. None work in isolation of the others and changes to one area will have a flow on effect. The key role of a business’ content strategy will be to connect the content components of the quad to the people components. The synergy between these areas will impact on how you will achieve your content goals. So when you’ve worked out what your content goals are and what form the content will take you would be asking yourself questions like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What resources do I need to achieve the content goals?</li>
  <li>Who do I need to get involved?</li>
  <li>Are there tools that could help me manage the process?</li>
</ul>

<p>Finding the answers to the questions requires collaboration. No man is an island and certainly a good content strategy is the same. The people you will need to be involved are the same people who should be consulted about how your content strategy will be implemented. Their level of understanding of the rationale behind decisions is directly proportional to their compliance. Let them help you create clear expectations of everyone in the process.</p>

<p>And here’s where we come to keeping your content customer focused. The content strategy you’ve created should translate to clear guidelines for your reviewers. A good content strategy will also resolve any disputes by being a source of truth. It’s the road map which always displays the right route and stands up to any backseat drivers.</p>

	      <div class="post-meta">By <a href="https://twitter.com/benchadfield" target="_blank">Ben Chadfield</a> - 03 December 2013</div>
	      <div class="post-content"><p>Four weeks ago we opened up the alpha for CS Workflow. We’re ready to start talking to people interested in joining the private beta. We’re looking for people that work with content regularly (at least weekly) and are willing to use CS Workflow as part of their content workflow. Get in touch if that sounds like you.</p>

<p>During the alpha we’ve received great feedback, which has kept us very busy. There have been 51 changes made and 3 issues fixed. We’re particularly happy about the low number of bugs found.</p>

<p>The changes have ranged from adding user avatars to completely overhauling how users are assigned to documents. Here are the significant changes we’ve made.</p>

<h3 id="content-autosave">Content autosave</h3>
<p>We added autosave because it’s an expected part of creating content. We also setup different states for the save button so you can be certain how safely you can navigate away from the content.</p>

<p>The content autosaves every 60 seconds if changes have been made. The save icon is orange if there are unsaved changes. It flashes white while the content is saving. A green save icon shows that the content is saved. Clicking the save icon will obviously save the content as well. A white save icon shows there are no unsaved changes since the content was loaded.</p>

<p>It might sound a bit confusing to read, but the icon states make sense when you’re working with content.</p>

<h3 id="workflow-state-changes">Workflow state changes</h3>
<p>Four weeks ago we had a reject state in the workflow. This allowed an approver to reject content. On paper this looked good, but is redundant when completing a review with comments achieves the same thing.</p>

<p>We removed reject and added the ability to park content, which puts it on hold. This takes the content out of the workflow and it won’t appear in anyone’s list of things that need their attention. Content can be parked before it is approved.</p>

<p>Parked content can only be put back into draft, so it needs to go through the whole workflow before it can be published. This reduces the risk of publishing out-of-date content, by giving reviewers a chance to raise anything that may have changed since it was parked.</p>

<h3 id="cascading-user-assignment">Cascading user assignment</h3>
<p>This has been our focus for the last 10 days. Originally users had to be added to each content item after it was created. It was an opt in model that added more work to creating content.</p>

<p>An idea came in through <a href="http://csworkflow.uservoice.com">Uservoice</a> to add assignments at category level. What came out of that is what we’re calling cascading user assignment.</p>

<p>We’re now using an opt out model. When someone accepts your invitation the default setting will be that they are assigned at the workspace level. These default assignments are added to all new content when it’s created. You can then add or remove assignments to fit the needs of the content.</p>

<p>Support for setting assignments at the category level has been coded, but we’ll wait to see how well the current method goes down before making it more complicated.</p>

<h3 id="other-changes-you-may-have-noticed">Other changes you may have noticed</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Support for avatars through the <a href="http://gravatar.com">Gravatar</a> service</li>
  <li>Toggle changes between version mark up</li>
  <li>Show/hide HTML version of content when ready for publish</li>
  <li>Recall button for bringing submitted content back to draft</li>
  <li>Renamed documents to content</li>
  <li>Content and category tables are searchable and sortable</li>

	      <div class="post-meta">By <a href="https://twitter.com/vclaringbull" target="_blank">Vicky Claringbull</a> - 06 July 2013</div>
	      <div class="post-content"><p>Sick of having to chase, follow up and undo other people’s changes to your copy? Do you need a way to track a document’s versions and changes as it progresses towards final approval? Are you constantly wishing for a way to make content review more transparent?</p>

<p>Welcome copywriters and content wizards to CS Workflow! At CS Workflow we’re focused on fixing one of the main headaches of content production: content review and approval. We understand that getting final approval for copy can be a painful and prolonged process for copywriters. Our aim is to empower copywriters. Getting the feedback and information you need to write great content should be one thing: simple.</p>

<p>Creating great content is all about having the right information, enthusiastic stakeholders and a workflow that supports each team member in their role. CS Workflow aspires to be a simple and intuitive workflow system which helps do just that. We’re developing a way of allowing the stakeholders in content production to interact with content in a way that is meaningful to the team, and most importantly drives the process forwards.</p>

<p>How will we do this? With your help! We will launch a closed beta and invite keen copywriters to trial and test our product. In helping us you’ll be able to benefit from a new workflow system that streamlines and organizes your WIP and in addition, contribute to the development of a product that may revolutionise and standardise the way online content is commissioned and reviewed.</p>

<p>Allow me to introduce ourselves: we’re Vicky Claringbull and Ben Chadfield, a husband and wife team with experience in publishing, product development, online marketing and a shared passion for the web and the content that drives it.  The CS Workflow initiative was driven by our ever-increasing realisation that in today’s world, creating good content has never been more important nor problematic.  In speaking with colleagues and friends about this issue we uncovered one common source of frustration. And hence, CS Workflow was born. We want, over the next few months, to find a solution to this problem and we hope that you’ll come on this journey with us. So stay tuned and primed, CS Workflow is on its way!</p>
