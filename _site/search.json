Content types can be used to add additional attributes to your content or as a way to tag your content as being of a particular type. Only admins are able to add and manage content types. To set up a new content type: Go to Settings and click the Content types tab. The Content types tab shows all the content types that exist in your workspace. Three content types exist by default: email, blog and tweet. Click the 'Add content type' button. This will bring up the New content type form. Enter a name for your content type. This is how it will be identified when new content is created. Add the properties of the content type. There are two types of properties: attribute (a text value, like an email subject line) and rule (a word or character count). Add more properties by clicking the 'Add property button'. There is no maximum or minimum number of properties you can have. Unwanted properties can be deleted by clicking the associated 'Remove' button. Click the 'Save content type' button to confirm your changes. The content type will now be available to be assigned to content items . Adding attributes Enter the name you want call your attribute, e.g. Author. The attribute's name will appear in all content that uses the content type. You also have the option of adding a default value for the attribute, e.g. Joe Blogs. If you enter a default value, this attribute will be pre-populated in content that uses the content type. Adding rules Rules are defined by the operator, value and count type. You have the option of limiting character or word counts, e.g. a tweet will have the rule 'Up to and including 140 characters'. When editing content with a content type rule, a counter will indicate if you are meeting the rule. There are no consequences in CS Workflow for breaking a rule you've set, such as not being able to save.

The 'no further setup' statement assumes several things, which if not true could cause problems. You are self-hosting and using Wordpress version 3.4 or older. The XML-RPC option is enabled by default for version 3.5 and above. If you're using a previous version then enable by going to Settings > Writing > Remote Publishing and checking the relevant checkbox.

The exception to this is the content owner: content owners cannot approve their own content. Content in the Approval stage is unable to be edited. If changes are required the content needs to be moved back to the Draft or Edit stages. Where there is a previous version of the content, differences between the versions are displayed: green indicates additions; red indicates deletions. The approver has two options: Approve To approve content the approver clicks the Approve button. Approved content automatically moves to the Ready stage. If there are multiple approvers, all must approve before the content will enter the Ready stage. All content approvals are recorded in the Approvals tab in Content. Give feedback Feedback is given via the comments section. The approver then clicks the Send feedback button. The content will automatically move to the Edit stage even if other approvers have yet to submit their feedback/approval. This avoids wasting an approver's time checking content that another approver is unsatisfied with. Tip: We recommend only having one approver in your workflow.

Step-by-step instructions have been provided on the right of the screen. 1. Name your template This name will help identify the template in the workspace. 2. Add HTML and CSS There are two ways to add HTML and CSS. The first and easiest way to add HTML and CSS is to use an existing webpage that has the same layout and design as the template you want to create. Enter the webpage's URL in the URL text field and click the blue 'Get layout' button. The HTML and CSS for the page will then be retrieved, added to the template form and altered so to display correctly in your workspace. The second way is to manually enter the HTML and CSS into the respective text areas. Only the HTML is required; the CSS is optional. 3. Add template tags Template tags are used to dynamically place the content being previewed in the template. Tags start and end with two curly brackets. The only required template tag is {{ body }} . Tags should be placed in the HTML where you want the content attribute to appear in the preview. Preview templates also support custom template tags, which can match content type attributes. For example the default blog content type has the Author attribute. The template tag for this attribute is {{ author }} .
