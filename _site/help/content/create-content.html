<p>The person who creates the content is known as the content owner.
<a href="/help/content/transfer-content-ownership.html">Ownership of content can be transferred</a>
to another team member if needed.</p>

<p>You can add content to your workspace by clicking on the 'Add content'
button. This will bring up the content form. The 'Add content'
button appears on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Overview</li>
  <li>The Content tab in Content</li>
  <li>The Category tab in Content</li>
</ul>

<p>The content form has four fields:</p>

<h3 id="name">Name</h3>
<p>This is the title of your content. Name is the only required field. The others are optional and can be
<a href="/help/content/change-content-category.html">changed later</a>.</p>

<h3 id="category">Category</h3>
<p>Your content's category is how you wish to file or group
your content in the workspace, e.g. August email campaign, Twitter
updates. The category name will autocomplete so if you type in the first
few letters of an existing category, you will be able to select that
category from a drop down. New categories can also be created by
entering them in this field.</p>

<h3 id="content-type">Content type</h3>
<p>The <a href="/help/content-types/add-content-type.html">content type</a>
of your content determines the attributes and rules of the content you want to create.</p>

<h3 id="preview-template">Preview template</h3>
<p>Selecting a <a href="/help/preview-templates/create-preview-templates.html">preview template</a>
will allow reviewers and approvers to see what the content will look like once published.</p>

<p>Click Save to open the content's page. You can now add content to the
content box.</p>

<p>All new content is placed in the <a href="/help/workflow/draft-content.html">Draft stage</a>.</p>
