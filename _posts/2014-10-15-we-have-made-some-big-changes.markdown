It\'s been a long time since you\'ve heard any news from us. Maybe you
thought that we\'d slipped quietly away. We haven\'t. In fact, we\'ve
been working really hard to make sure CS Workflow keeps the promise of
making your content workflow easier.

After launch we could see that our tool wasn\'t good enough. The biggest
problem was that we\'d made accessing content more difficult for
reviewers. They had a new system that came with a perceived learning
curve and passwords they had to remember. This meant that content
wasn\'t getting reviewed and approved as hoped through CS Workflow. Not
a great start.

We stopped our marketing efforts to work exclusively on meeting our
promise and making improvements. You\'re not supposed to do that. All
advise was to keep selling, but we didn\'t feel good about pushing a
tool that we weren\'t proud of.

We\'re really happy with the latest batch of changes and now it\'s time
to start talking about them. These improvements are all available for
you to check out today.

Here's a short video that shows off what we've done.

###  New design for the content page 

The new content page is the most visible change we've made. The review
and approval view is very simple with the options and information
stripped right back. The new design puts the focus on the content and
providing feedback. This makes it much easier for reviewers to jump
right in and get started.

###  No sign in 

The new request email sent to reviewers and approvers includes a secure
URL to the content. Clicking the URL securely logs them in and takes
them directly to the content you want them to look at. To keep the URL
safe there is an expiry time, which is currently 3 days. A new request
can be sent if the old one expires.

###  Easier to send requests 

Speaking of sending requests, we\'ve made that a whole lot easier. You
set who the request goes to exactly like the \'To\' field of an email.
Like email you can send review and approval requests to anyone with an
email address. If you send a request to someone new to the team, they
are added and can jump straight in to reviewing content. It\'s optional
for them to setup their account and password.

###  No more complicated roles 

There\'s only one role and that\'s admin. What you are able to do is
based on what you\'ve been asked to do. If you\'ve been asked to review
content, you are a reviewer for that content. Same goes for approving.
Admins are the only team members who can add content. They also manage
the workspace, including content types and preview templates. Everybody
else has read-only access to content in the workspace.

###  More previewing options 

There are now default preview templates to support the default content
types. The most popular content type is blog, making up nearly 70% of
the content put through CS Workflow. Email is just over 15%. The new
design of the content page puts more emphasis on previewing the content.
We\'ve added basic templates for all three default content types, which
are blog, email and tweet. You don\'t need to add a preview template,
simply add a blog content type to your content and it\'ll display like a
basic blog with title, author and published date. This makes all the
difference to reviewers who can preview the content.

###  Managing your sent requests 

We\'ve updated how you keep track of what stage our content is in and
who is working on it. You can see who is actively involved, who has
completed your requests, and how long ago you asked them to review. You
can also resend requests to any stragglers who are holding up your
content.

We\'d love to hear what you think about the changes. Did we miss
anything you were hoping for? What other changes help you get good
feedback from your reviewers?
